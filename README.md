# Short project title

__Research Question__
Is there a difference in pricing between super hosts and non-super hosts in Venice?

## Motivation

Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved. Tip given in tutorial: Write as though if you work for Airbnb

## Data
The team project draws on datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.

## Method and results

A quantitative analysis will be made on the dataset of Airbnb to answer the research question wether there is difference in pricing between super hosts and non-super hosts. The method is quantitative because we measure in numbers. The columns of the dataset of Venice will be analysed from an CSV file in R-studio and uploaded to Github.  

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files.

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## More resources

Point interested users to any related literature and/or documentation.
